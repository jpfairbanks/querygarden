QueryGarden
===========

Growing healythy applications in fertile SQL.


Many software packages within the OHDSI ecosystem rely on SQL query
generation, which is fraught with security risks and compatibility
issues. We introduce an ahead of time query server, QueryGarden, to
enable access to queries over HTTP to reduce the risk of SQL injection
attacks, improve the lifecycle management of analytical queries and
provide both batch processing for training analytics models as well as
single patient queries for near real time applications. The Query Garden
is a place to plant queries for analytics that grow into stable, secure,
and user friendly applications.

This software has been presented at the OHDSI Symposium as research software.
